# cube-random-movement
Next video: https://youtu.be/FYDifhLwlpA  Have a gameobject (cube) move randomly about a scene. We are actually going to place a few random gameobjects for the cube to go between. We use a random function to tell it which point to move toward. When it reaches that destination it randomly picks a new one.    Index out of range error - check the waypoint tag name to make sure that the random waypoint array was populated? You can run the script in debug mode and put a breakpoint on the line stating it has the error to see what the values are and verify.
